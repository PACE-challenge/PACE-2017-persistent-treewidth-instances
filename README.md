# Treewidth: Challenging bonus instances (PACE 2017)

The [instance set](//github.com/PACE-challenge/Treewidth-PACE-2017-instances) used in the _exact_ treewidth challenge of PACE 2017 is now considered to be too easy. Therefore, this bonus instance set has been created to offer a fresh and difficult challenge. In particular, solving these instances in five minutes would require a 1000x speed improvement over the best exact treewidth solvers of PACE 2017.

[gr/](gr/) contains 100 instances for exact treewidth computation.

[td/](td/) contains the optimal tree decompositions (if known).

[instances.csv](instances.csv) lists the instances, the treewidth (if known), and the time required to compute the treewidth.

The instances are released under the [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
